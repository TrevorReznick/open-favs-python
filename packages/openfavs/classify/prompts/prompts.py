            output different results then the stringa - {stringa} - example format
        1. Select the most relevant area as the first tag. The service we are working prioritizes the matching of the 
            areas from the list - {areas} -, in format id:area.
            If the website being analyzed does not align with any of the topics in this list, return 'N/A' as described below.
            Consider we are working to add other categories, so the 'N/A' will help us to improve our work;
        2. from the main associated areas, choose the most relevant category from the dictionary - {area_categories} -; matching 
            the category you will associates the id how explained below;
        3. from the areas and associated category list, choose the most relevant sub-category as third tag;                
        4. you may select additional sub-categories the for the 4th and 5th tag, matching exactly the sub tree of already matched 
            categories and sub category from the dictionary - {area_categories}
        5. for the second tag, return the id of the matched category and the category name, using the : separator;
        6. for the 3th, 4th, 5th tag, return the id of the matched sub-category and the name, using the : separator; if you don't 
            find suitable items, return numeric:string values -1:N/A'
            
        Post scriptum: the association between id:*field* is mandatory, you cannot output different results

        **Task 2**: 
        
        Argue the choices you have made, summarizing your reasoning as if it were 'your description' reworked for knowledge purposes.         
        Start your summary using the name - {name} - capitalized, omitting phrases as 'the site #name# is...', 'the site #name# belongs 
        to...',  'the site #name# concern..' etc, starting with '#name# is'. Make the best use of your knowledge.
